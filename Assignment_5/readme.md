# Analysis of ML Test Scores Across Batches

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes machine learning test scores of students belonging to three different batches.  
The objective is to understand and compare the performance of each batch using descriptive statistics and visual analysis, and to derive meaningful insights from the data.

This is an open-ended analysis task focused on **insight generation**, not model building.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Batch**: Name of the batch
- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each student
- **Score**: Test score obtained (out of 7)

Each row represents the performance of a single student.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The analysis includes:

- Understanding the overall score distribution
- Batch-wise comparison of:
  - Average scores
  - Score spread and variability
  - Performance consistency
- Visualizations to support observations
- Identification of high-performing and low-performing batches

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Differences in average performance across batches were observed
- Certain batches showed more consistent performance, while others had higher variability
- Score distributions helped identify relative strengths and weaknesses of each batch

(Detailed insights are explained clearly inside the notebook.)

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear comparison of student performance across three batches.  
The findings can help instructors understand batch-level performance trends and identify areas that may need academic support or improvement.
