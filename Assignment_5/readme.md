## 📊 Task 1 - Analysis on ML Test Scores
**Exploratory Data Analysis Case Study**

*Innomatics Research Labs – Data Science Internship*

This project analyzes machine learning test scores across three student batches to compare performance and derive meaningful insights using descriptive statistics and visual analysis.

The focus of this work is on **insight generation and batch-wise comparison**, rather than predictive modeling.
