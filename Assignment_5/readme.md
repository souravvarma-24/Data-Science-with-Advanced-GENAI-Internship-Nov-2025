## 📊 Task 1 - Analysis on ML Test Scores
**Exploratory Data Analysis Case Study**

This project analyzes machine learning test scores across three student batches to compare performance and derive meaningful insights using descriptive statistics and visual analysis.

The focus of this work is insight generation and batch-wise comparison, not predictive modeling.

### 📊 Dataset Overview

| Column   | Description               |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Batch   | Batch name                |
| User_ID | Unique student identifier |
| Score   | Test score (out of 7)     |

Each row represents one student’s test performance.

### 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### 🔍 Analysis Highlights
- Distribution analysis of scores  
- Batch-wise comparison of average performance  
- Evaluation of score consistency and variability  
- Visual analysis to support insights  

### ✅ Conclusion
The analysis highlights differences in performance across batches and shows that understanding variability provides deeper insight than averages alone.
